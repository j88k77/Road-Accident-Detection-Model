# Road-Accident-Detection-Model
This project aims to develop a web application using Streamlit for real-time accident detection. Users will be able to input their Twilio credentials and upload video files. The application will utilize a pre-trained machine learning model to analyze the video content and determine the likelihood of an accident. A 10-minute accident video will be used for initial model training.

Key Features:

User-friendly Streamlit interface for easy interaction

Integration with Twilio API for credential input and potential notifications

Pre-trained machine learning model for accident detection

Ability to upload and analyze video files
